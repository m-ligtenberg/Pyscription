*AI-enhanced command-line assistant for Python development - operates like a software physician*

## Overview
Pyscription is an AI-enhanced command-line assistant designed to help you maintain, refactor and analyze Python code. Although it operates like a doctor reviewing a patient file â€“ diagnosing patterns, prescribing fixes and guiding your workflow â€“ it provides intelligent, context-aware assistance for Python development.

## Core Philosophy
- **Production Ready**: Suited for real projects and active codebases
- **Security First**: Includes multiple vulnerability checks mapped to CWE standards
- **AI Powered**: Uses locally hosted language models for intelligent suggestions
- **Privacy Conscious**: All analysis happens on your machine, no external data transmission
- **Learning-Based**: Grows smarter from your coding patterns and interactions
- **Zero Database Anxiety**: File-based storage using JSON and compressed pickle files

## Best Practices and Workflow Tips  
- Edit claude.md after every major task so in a new session he will know what to do next and where he left off
- Always try and work modular, no files exceeding the thousands of lines, if you can make a helper for it or a different file with the function then please do so

## ðŸ’Š **MEDICATION-THEMED COMMAND STRUCTURE**

Pyscription operates with a medical metaphor, offering different "treatments" for your code:

### Core Commands:
```bash
python3 -m pyscription [options] [file]

Options:
  --pill             Apply a mild correction (lint, style, syntax)
  --inject           Perform targeted code changes
  --overdose         Apply all available fixes without prompts
  --refill           Repeat the previous operation
  --side-effects     Display a list of recent changes
  --checkup          Comprehensive codebase health examination
  --emergency        Critical issue immediate diagnosis and fix
  --therapy          Interactive guided code improvement session
  --vitals           Real-time code health monitoring and metrics
  --prescription     Generate detailed improvement recommendations
  --doctor           Start conversational session with the AI Doctor
  --surgeon          Run autonomous codebase improvement (Surgeon mode)
  --analyze <file>   Perform static analysis on a single file
  --search <term>    Semantic search in Python documentation
  --setup            Initialize the environment and documentation
```

### Operating Modes:

#### Doctor Mode (`--doctor`)
- Interactive conversational AI assistant
- Natural language queries about Python topics
- Code snippet analysis and explanations
- Real-time syntax highlighting and focused dialogue

#### Surgeon Mode (`--surgeon`)
- Autonomous codebase analysis and improvement
- Comprehensive project review and refactoring
- Automated task execution with backup maintenance
- Progressive improvement plans with time/task limits

#### Security Analysis
- Built-in vulnerability detection (SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
- CWE standard mapping
- OWASP compliance assistance
- Hardcoded credential detection

#### Pattern Discovery
- ML-based design pattern recognition (Singleton, Factory, Observer)
- Code smell identification
- Architecture consistency maintenance
- Template and improvement suggestions

## ðŸš€ **CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS** (2025-07-26)

## Development Memory
- Added reminder to update claude.md with every big update to track project evolution and maintain documentation
- **COMPLETED: Sticky Container Terminal Interface** - Successfully implemented terminal-friendly interface with sticky header showing current directory and scrollable content area within bordered container. Perfect fit for normal terminal windows with responsive width (60-120 chars).
