# Pyscription ðŸš€ - Your Complete Python Development AI Assistant

*Renamed from PythonMentor - Now fully modularized and production-ready!*

## Overview
Pyscription is a locally-running, machine learning-enhanced Python development assistant that learns from your coding patterns and provides intelligent suggestions. It combines documentation analysis, pattern discovery, and semantic search to create a personalized Python mentor.

## Core Philosophy
- **100% Local**: No external API calls, all processing happens on your machine
- **Learning-Based**: Grows smarter from your coding patterns and interactions
- **Documentation-Driven**: Leverages the entire Python documentation for context-aware help
- **Pattern Discovery**: Uses ML to discover common coding patterns and anti-patterns
- **Zero Database Anxiety**: File-based storage using JSON and compressed pickle files

## Best Practices and Workflow Tips  
- Edit claude.md after every major task so in a new session he will know what to do next and where he left off
- Always try and work modular, no files exceeding the thousands of lines, if you can make a helper for it or a different file with the function then please do so
